This dashboard was built for my **SQL** class.

We were required to explore/analyze the database by "macrogiro" and build a small Presentation/Excel, but I opted for a dashboard instead.

It was built using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and its options for building dashboards using Rmarkdown.

The interactive graphs were built using [plotly](https://plot.ly/) (javascript library).

For more information about the packages used, please check the code for the dashboard or send a message.
